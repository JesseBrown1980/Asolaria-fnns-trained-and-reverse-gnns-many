# Asolaria — THE MAP (how these repos connect)

One system, split across repos. This map is identical in every repo — find this repo by name in the
tables below to see where you are; follow the links to walk the rest.

## The spine — mechanism → running fleet (read backwards, newest → fleet)
```

## Prism/Comb 0-loss (2026-07-01) — satellite entry
One law: every prism/comb operation in Asolaria's transport layers is a **bijection**; entropy is
invariant under bijection (`H(f(X)) = H(X)`), so re-relating information costs **0 loss** — and nothing
claims compression below Shannon's bound. One fabric, two directions: **forward = comb**
(collision-avoidance, execution isolation), **backward = prism** (collision-causation, many→1).

**Where THIS repo sits on that law — the ensemble scores the prism direction:**
- **reverse_gain many→1 IS the prism recombination direction.** G3 reverse-gain (and the many
  reverse-GNN variants) runs the backward pass as a scorer: forward signals separate like comb teeth,
  reverse-gain inverts deception (`mask` → negative, `leak` → positive) and folds the many signals back
  toward one verdict. The 7-GNN / 8-signal HOOKWALL SCORE is the many→1 recombination seen from the
  result side.
- **Boundary held (anti-drift): scores are PROPOSALS, not proof.** The 0-loss theorem covers the exact
  layers *underneath* the ensemble (256↔1024 transcode — **MEASURED**, Q-PRISM `53023b6`; CRT prime
  lanes; content-addressed handles = addressing capacity, never compression). A trained scorer is NOT
  a bijection — inference discards information by design — so no ensemble score may be upgraded into a
  system-truth verdict. Verdicts belong to the owning gates (G4 GLSM `MISTAKE_FLAGGED` → Fischer
  Tier-0 hard BLOCK, white rooms, operator gate): the **integrity dual** of the bijection chain —
  verification = recomputation, which is why a fabricated score cannot reach consent.
- **Caveat stands (do not soften):** the README's class-imbalance caveat is load-bearing — the corpus
  is ~99.99% positive (315,209 / 315,249; only 40 benign), so acc 0.9992 / recall 1.0 / f1 0.9996 are
  **imbalance-inflated**: an upper bound on a skewed split, NOT a calibrated baseline. A
  proposal-not-proof scorer with a disclosed caveat is exactly the honest form this law requires.

Scope tags: 256↔1024 rung **MEASURED** (Q-PRISM `53023b6`); the 43+ level ladder as a groupoid
(`T_ji ∘ T_ij = id`, path-independent) = **CANON** frame; every other rung **UNVERIFIED** until its own
round-trip proof. E=0 — docs-only propagation, nothing fired. Cross-links: Q-PRISM proofs
(`53023b6` / `79e8d63` / `de00aca`) · `Asolaria-waves-and-cascades-…` (the avoid/cause duality) ·
`what-is-asolaria-…` (reductions boundary) · `N-Nest-Prime-…` (integrity dual).

## Current state & evolution (2026-06-28) — read this, don't flatten it
Asolaria is a **2.5-month archaeology**, not a flat stack. **Capability lineage:** auto-approval switch →
dashboard → multi-agent → local+web MCP + code-wiki → index language (pixels-first) → cubes-as-catalogs
in expanding Brown-Hilbert space → map-map-mapped → cube-cube-cubed → 256-symbol language → 1024-symbol
language → (asked 2048 — chose instead) **HBI/HBP + binary/hex/hash/sha/crypto-as-tokens** → **8-byte host
process** (replaces the ancient Node processes, for speed). The fabric's own 27-strata record is the
`archaeology_timeline` (birth 2026-02-22 → FABRIC EPOCH → genome).

The system **now** is **multiple of everything**: **16 levels (L0-L15) · multiple MCP engines (17) ·
multiple emitters · multiple languages** (index / pixels-first / BEHCS-256 / BEHCS-1024 / HBI-HBP).
**Current frame = 60D HyperBEHCS / BEHCS-1024**; 35D / 47D / 49D + BEHCS-256 are **bridge strata** below
it (old decodes new). The **kernel** is `asolaria-federation-1024` (the Rust 8-byte host). The current
effort is **"map while upgrading"** — and **this repo web is that map**.

## How it all fits
The **emitter [2]** produces 200ns PID signals; the **router [1]** delivers them; the **fleet [0]**
materialises spindles. Each spindle obeys the **reduction principle [3]** / **algorithm [4]** and the
**collision discipline [5]**. After every trigger, the spindle's answer runs the **post-trigger pipeline**
(`Shannon-and-the-gnns-stage`), scored by the **trained GNNs/FNNs** (`Asolaria-fnns-trained-…`), and the
**white rooms** (liris LEG-1) keep the genius / compact the mistakes — the PRISM many→1 reduction, seen
from the result side. The **back end** (`Asolaria-the-after-100-billion-run-…`) then absorbs the gulped
data, decomposes + mints the cubes, and — operator-gated — promotes the geniuses into supervisors/PIDs.
All gated / E=0 / describe-only — no fire, no cutover without operator authority.
